# metrohacks-hackathon

As a team of 4 we participated in the [MetroHacks 2022](https://metrohacks.dev) hackathon where the aim was to create a project on a prototype for a solution to a current problem within the Healthcare sector. [Medical Guardian](https://devpost.com/software/doctorguardian) was the name of the solution that our team came up with.

The app aims to:
- search reliable info on medicine
- make sure only suitable medicine is returned
- it is available
- the restrictions do not contradict the patient's allergies and such

Use Cases:
1. As a doctor I want to get and delete information about a piece medicine so I can have up to date data base with medicines
2. As a doctor I want to edit only "comment" field information about a medicine so I can add useful information to my data
3. As a doctor I want to see a table with picked medicine with important fields like name of medicine, contraindications, dose, etc. so I can see save more time to be more attentionable for kids and parents needs 
4. As a parent  I want the doctor to be less burocracy so my child can get as much attention to my kid as possible 
5. As a kid I want the doctor to be a professional so he/she can help me with my issues and better provide treatment
6. As a part of hospital managment I want doctors to be more productive during a day and have good metrics so my bosses will recognise our productivity
